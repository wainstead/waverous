  Clarifying Questions:
  1. Project Purpose: Is this a fork or custom version of LambdaMOO, or is it the original LambdaMOO server?
I see some custom extensions like ext-FUP and ext-xml.

The goal of this project is to turn a 1990s C project into a modern C++ project; a lot of work wound up being about
updating the Autotools though, which was very rewarding.

  2. Target Platform: What's your target platform for running this? (Linux, macOS, etc.) I see it has both
BSD and SysV networking code.

Yes, just Linux and BSD/macOS. When I last worked on this project ARM was not even a thing, and running Lambdamoo on a Raspberri Pi would be a good target.

  3. Dependencies: Do you remember what external dependencies this project needs? (e.g., specific libraries,
											 development tools)

I do not.

  4. Last Working State: When you last worked on this, was it compiling and running successfully? Any known
issues?

Yes, in fact my work was then copied from this project for another fork called stunt.io

  5. Development Goals: What kind of updates are you planning to make? (bug fixes, new features,
									    modernization, etc.)

Bug fixes and modernization... integrating an LLM would be nice, i.e. a Lambdamoo object the players can talk to, which communicates with Chatgpt or Gemini or other

  6. Build Environment: Do you have a preference for how to set up the build environment? (Docker, native
												   build, etc.)
Native for now, but a Docker image would be spiffy later on.
