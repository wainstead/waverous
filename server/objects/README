MCP: the MUD Client Protocol is an attempt to provide a standard
message format on which to build MUD-based client-server
applications. This directory contains the JHCore implementation; for
more information see http://www.moo.mud.org/mcp/


These are a handful of objects I've created over the years; toys,
mostly:

algoredoll.moo		gwbushdoll.moo		parrot.moo
clippy.moo		knights.moo		puppet.moo
engrish.moo		lander.moo		timer.moo
governor.moo		michaelscott.moo

To load them via tf, do:

/quote 'objects/filename.moo

Many (all?) of them contain ANSI color codes in their titles (names)
so you'll see gobbledeegook for their names. Until I get around to
adding ANSI color support to one or more of the databases.

There are other objects missing as well; and a function called $name,
it seems... but this has long been one of the pitfalls of sharing MOO
code: a dump of some object may contain object references or code
references that don't exist in your copy of the MOO database. It's a
problem that needs solving.
