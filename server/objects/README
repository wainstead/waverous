These are a handful of objects I've created over the years; toys, mostly.

To load them via tf, do:

/quote 'objects/filename.moo

Many (all?) of them contain ANSI color codes in their titles (names)
so you'll see gobbledeegook for their names. Until I get around to
adding ANSI color support to one or more of the databases.

There are other objects missing as well; and a function called $name,
it seems... but this has long been one of the pitfalls of sharing MOO
code: a dump of some object may contain object references or code
references that don't exist in your copy of the MOO database. It's a
problem that needs solving.
