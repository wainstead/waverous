These are a handful of objects I've created over the years; toys, mostly.

To load them via tf, do:

/quote 'objects/filename.moo

Many (all?) of them contain ANSI color codes in their titles (names)
so you'll see gobbledeegook for their names. Until I get around to
adding ANSI color support to one or more of the databases.
