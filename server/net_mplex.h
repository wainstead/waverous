/* This describes the complete set of procedures that a multiplexing wait
 * implementation must provide.
 *
 * The `mplex' abstraction provides a way to wait until it is possible to
 * perform an I/O operation on any of a set of file descriptors without
 * blocking.  Uses of the abstraction always have the following form:
 *
 *      mplex_clear();
 *      { mplex_add_reader(fd)  or  mplex_add_writer(fd) }*
 *      timed_out = mplex_wait(timeout);
 *      { mplex_is_readable(fd)  or  mplex_is_writable(fd) }*
 *
 * The set of file descriptors maintained by the abstraction is referred to
 * below as the `wait set'.  Each file descriptor in the wait set is marked
 * with the kind of I/O (i.e., reading, writing, or both) desired.
 */
