 * was running, meaning that f() always had to copy x to modify it.  With
 * BYTECODE_REDUCE_REF enabled, f() could be called with the last reference
 * to the value of x.  So for example, x={@x,y} can (if there are no other
 * references to the value of x in variables or properties) just append to

 * no suspended tasks in the database you are loading.  (It might work
 * anyway, but hey, it's your database.)  This restriction will be
 * lifted in a future version of the server software.  Consider this
