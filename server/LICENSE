The original license for the LambdaMOO server code (the Xerox one) is
a BSD-compatible license. All sources in this project have been
audited to make sure they are compliant; while a few sources are GPL,
they are not compiled into the Waverous LambdaMOO server code. They
are standalone programs and are listed below.

Unlicensed files:
    str_intern.h
    str_intern.c
    db_tune.h   

These were contributed over time to the project but never had any
copyright or licensing notices in them.

   Modified from the Python-1.3 distribution for use in LambdaMOO
   by Pavel Curtis, 27 October 1995.

   This code draws many ideas from the regular expression packages by
   Henry Spencer of the University of Toronto and Richard Stallman of the
   Free Software Foundation.

   Emacs-specific code and syntax table code is almost directly borrowed
   from GNU regexp.
